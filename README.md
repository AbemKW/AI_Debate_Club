# AI Debate Club

> **Two AI agents. One topic. A full debate â€” with research, memory, and personality.**

A multi-agent AI system where two roleplaying agents argue user-defined topics, supported by web research, persistent memory, and expressive persona-driven reasoning â€” all orchestrated via LangGraph and powered by Groq.

##  Features

**Multi-Agent Orchestration**  
- Pro, Con, and Moderator agents take turns using **LangGraph** state machines and conditional routing.

**Persona-Driven Debates**  
- Assign any personas (e.g., "Socrates vs Elon Musk", "Trump vs The Rock") â€” agents adapt tone, style, and rhetoric dynamically.

**Web Research with Bias Simulation**  
- Each agent runs **biased web searches** to find supporting evidence and fact-check opponents using DuckDuckGo.
- Search queries are LLM-generated for maximum relevance.

**Persistent Memory**  
- Agents remember past arguments using **LangMem**.
- Avoid repetition, build on previous points, and call out contradictions.

**Rhetorical Diversity Engine**  
- Forces rotation of rhetorical styles (analogy, data, anecdote, emotion) to prevent monotony.
- Ensures unique voice across rounds.

**Streamlit UI**  
- Interactive interface showing real-time debate flow, citations, and agent roles.
- Easy for non-technical users to engage.
